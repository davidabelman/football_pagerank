Exploration of using PageRank to measure football team strength

See blog posts for details (e.g. https://davidabelman.wordpress.com/2015/03/02/modelling-football-team-strength-using-pagerank/). 

In this repo are exploratory scripts, each blog post links to a separate script, some work is copied between scripts.

Once I have finished the exploratory analysis, I may write up a condensed final set of Python files separate to this, more suitable for sharing.
